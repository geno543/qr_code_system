# 🔧 QR Code Issue RESOLVED! ✅

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED!**
The error `column "token" does not exist` has been resolved by implementing a database column mapping system.

## 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**
1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The database had `qr_token` but code expected `token`
2. **Column Mapping**: Added automatic translation between app and database formats
3. **Backward Compatibility**: System now works with existing database structure

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Server running on: **http://localhost:3000**
- ✅ Database connection: **Working**
- ✅ QR generation: **Working**
- ✅ Column mapping: **Implemented**

## 🚀 **How to Use Your System:**

### Step 1: Access Admin Panel
1. Visit: **http://localhost:3000/admin**
2. Password: **genoo**

### Step 2: Upload Excel File
- Excel must have columns: **name** and **id**
- System will auto-generate QR codes
- QR codes stored as base64 data in cloud database

### Step 3: Use Scanner
- Visit: **http://localhost:3000/scanner**
- Camera-based QR scanning
- Real-time attendance tracking

## 🎯 **Database Schema Mapping:**
| Application | Database | 
|-------------|----------|
| `attendee_id` | `ticket_id` |
| `token` | `qr_token` |
| `qr_code` | `qr_code_path` |
| `scanned` | `is_scanned` |

## 🔄 **No More Setup Needed:**
Your system is now working with the existing Supabase database structure. The mapping layer handles all column name differences automatically.
